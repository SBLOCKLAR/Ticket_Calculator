# TICKETSCalc

This project was something I created for my position of Onboarding Assistant in merchant services.  Part of my job was filling out Merchant Processing Applications.  This required me to determine annual volumes from the average monthly income split by card type processed.  

Plugging into the calculator wasn't time consuming, but did create a wide margin of potential error.

I use Math.ceil(when calling the visaMC) function because when Avg Monthly Income was "15000" or "15000000", the visaMC value was rounding down one. It just looks neater.
